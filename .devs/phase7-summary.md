# Phase 7: Multi-Image Gallery - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE (Backend + Frontend)

### Overview
Phase 7 successfully implements a comprehensive multi-image gallery system for products, allowing up to 10 images per product with full management capabilities including upload, reorder, primary selection, and deletion.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Backend (100% Complete)

#### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_01_20_000001_create_product_images_table.php`

- ✅ UUID-based primary keys
- ✅ Foreign keys to products and tenants
- ✅ Image paths (full + thumbnail)
- ✅ Primary image flag (is_primary)
- ✅ Sort order for display sequence
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance
- ✅ Cascade deletes for referential integrity

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_images (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL,
  image_url VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  thumbnail_url VARCHAR(500),
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Model Layer
**File:** `src/Pms/Infrastructure/Models/ProductImage.php`

- ✅ UUID auto-generation
- ✅ Eloquent relationships (Product, Tenant)
- ✅ Query scopes: `forTenant()`, `forProduct()`, `ordered()`, `primary()`
- ✅ URL accessors for storage paths
- ✅ Proper fillable/guarded properties

#### 3. API Endpoints
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductImageController.php`

All endpoints under `/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/products/{productId}/images`:

1. **GET /images** - List all images (ordered)
2. **POST /images** - Upload multiple images
   - Batch upload support
   - Auto thumbnail generation (200x200)
   - Max 10 images validation
   - First image auto-set as primary
3. **DELETE /images/{imageId}** - Delete image
   - Removes files from storage
   - Auto-promotes next image if deleting primary
4. **PATCH /images/{imageId}/primary** - Set primary image
   - Unsets all others automatically
5. **PATCH /images/reorder** - Bulk reorder
   - Accepts array of image IDs

#### 4. Product Model Integration
**File:** `src/Pms/Infrastructure/Models/Product.php`

- ✅ `images()` relationship - HasMany, ordered by sort_order
- ✅ `primaryImage()` relationship - HasMany with is_primary filter

#### 5. Routes Registration
**File:** `routes/api.php`

- ✅ All routes protected by `auth:api` middleware
- ✅ Team context middleware applied
- ✅ Proper route ordering to avoid conflicts

#### 6. OpenAPI Documentation
**File:** `openapi.yaml`

- ✅ All 5 endpoints documented
- ✅ ProductImage schema defined
- ✅ Request/response examples
- ✅ Error responses (403, 404, 422)
- ✅ Permission requirements noted

---

### Frontend (100% Complete)

#### 1. Type Definitions
**File:** `frontend/src/types/index.ts`

```typescript
export interface ProductImage {
  id: string;
  product_id: string;
  tenant_id: string;
  image_url: string;
  thumbnail_url: string | null;
  is_primary: boolean;
  sort_order: number;
}

// Updated Product interface
interface Product {
  // ... existing fields
  images?: ProductImage[];
  primary_image?: ProductImage;
}
```

#### 2. API Client Methods
**File:** `frontend/src/api/productApi.ts`

- ✅ `getProductImages()` - Fetch images
- ✅ `uploadProductImages()` - Batch upload with FormData
- ✅ `deleteProductImage()` - Delete single image
- ✅ `setProductImagePrimary()` - Set primary
- ✅ `reorderProductImages()` - Bulk reorder

#### 3. ProductImageGallery Component
**File:** `frontend/src/components/domain/products/ProductImageGallery.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Multi-file upload (drag & drop or click)
- ✅ Image validation (type, size max 2MB)
- ✅ Upload progress indicator (animated bar)
- ✅ Image limit badge (X/10)
- ✅ Responsive 2-column grid
- ✅ HTML5 drag & drop for reordering
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag
- ✅ Primary image badge (star icon)
- ✅ Hover actions (set primary, delete)
- ✅ Lightbox/zoom view (full-screen modal)
- ✅ Empty state with icon
- ✅ Loading state
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions
- ✅ Auto-refresh after changes

**Props:**
```typescript
interface ProductImageGalleryProps {
  tenantId: string;
  productId: string;
  images?: ProductImage[];
  onImagesChange?: () => void;
}
```

#### 4. Integration with Existing Pages

**ProductEditPage** (`frontend/src/pages/backend/products/ProductEditPage.tsx`)
- ✅ Replaced single image upload with ProductImageGallery
- ✅ Removed old image state management
- ✅ Simplified form submission (no image handling needed)

**ProductDetailPage** (`frontend/src/pages/backend/products/ProductDetailPage.tsx`)
- ✅ Added ProductImageGallery with edit capabilities
- ✅ Permission-gated (products.update required)
- ✅ Fallback to single image for view-only users
- ✅ Refresh product data on image changes

#### 5. Component Export
**File:** `frontend/src/components/domain/products/index.ts`
- ✅ Exported ProductImageGallery for easy import

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### IMMUTABLE RULES ✅
- ✅ **Tenant-scoped**: All operations include tenant_id validation
- ✅ **Permission-gated**: `products.update` required for all mutations
- ✅ **Guard**: Uses `api` guard
- ✅ **Team context**: Middleware sets Spatie team context from route
- ✅ **No global roles**: All permissions tenant-scoped

### Data Validation
- ✅ File type: image/* only
- ✅ File size: Max 2MB per image
- ✅ Image count: Max 10 per product
- ✅ Required fields validation
- ✅ Foreign key constraints

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### Optional Features (Not in Phase 7 Scope)
1. **Image Cropping:**
   - Modal with crop tool before upload
   - Preset aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 4:3)

2. **Image Optimization:**
   - Client-side compression before upload
   - WebP conversion option
   - Multiple thumbnail sizes

3. **Bulk Image Management:**
   - Copy images from another product
   - Bulk upload via ZIP file
   - Image library/media manager

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Image alt text and captions
   - Image analytics (views, clicks)
   - CDN integration
   - Watermarking

### Data Migration
**Migrate existing single images to new system:**
```php
// Artisan command: php artisan products:migrate-images
// Pseudocode:
foreach (Product with image_url as $product) {
    ProductImage::create([
        'product_id' => $product->id,
        'tenant_id' => $product->tenant_id,
        'image_url' => $product->image_url,
        'thumbnail_url' => $product->thumbnail_url,
        'is_primary' => true,
        'sort_order' => 0,
    ]);
}
```

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Eager Loading:**
   ```php
   Product::with('images')->get();
   ```

2. **Thumbnail Usage:**
   - Always use thumbnails in list views
   - Full images only in detail/lightbox

3. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Images loaded after product data
   - Pagination for products with many images (future)

4. **Caching:**
   - Consider caching product images list
   - CDN for static image delivery

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. No image editing (crop, rotate, filters) - by design
2. No bulk upload via drag & drop to gallery - single/multiple file select only
3. No image metadata (alt text, captions) - can be added later
4. Old single-image endpoints still exist (for backward compatibility)

### Potential Issues:
- Large image uploads may timeout on slow connections (consider chunked upload later)
- No progress for individual images in batch upload (shows overall progress)

---

## 📝 Documentation Updates

### Updated Files:
1. ✅ `PRODUCT-MANAGEMENT-ROADMAP.md` - Phase 7 marked complete
